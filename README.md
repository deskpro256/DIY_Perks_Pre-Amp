PCB files for the project from DIY Perks video:

Need to be tested, but these are basically orderable boards.

As for the parts for THT, I didn't use any particular parts so you could buy the same parts listed in the videos description.
SMD version should be 90% done by JLCPCB and only some hand soldering will be required, mostly for the connectors or bare wires, THAT1512 and the +-15V PSU.

THAT1512 replacement parts:

THAT1510
INA217
INA163
SSM2019
SSM2017

More coming soon!
